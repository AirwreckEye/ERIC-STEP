 <h3>Kaâ€™Ba
 by Amiri Baraka</h3>


A closed window looks down

on a dirty courtyard, and Black people


call across or scream across or walk across

defying physics in the stream of their will. 


Our world is full of sound

Our world is more lovely than anyone's

tho we suffer, and kill each other

and sometimes fail to walk the air. 


We are beautiful people

With African imaginations

full of masks and dances and swelling chants 		

with African eyes, and noses, and arms

tho we sprawl in gray chains in a place

full of winters, when what we want is sun. 


We have been captured,

and we labor to make our getaway, into the ancient image; into a new 


Correspondence with ourselves

and our Black family. We need magic

now we need the spells, to raise up

return, destroy,and create. What will be


the sacred word?

<h3>Caged Bird
By Maya Angelou</h3>


A free bird leaps

on the back of the wind   

and floats downstream   

till the current ends

and dips his wing

in the orange sun rays

and dares to claim the sky.


But a bird that stalks

down his narrow cage

can seldom see through

his bars of rage

his wings are clipped and   

his feet are tied

so he opens his throat to sing.


The caged bird sings   

with a fearful trill   

of things unknown   

but longed for still   

and his tune is heard   

on the distant hill   

for the caged bird   

sings of freedom.


The free bird thinks of another breeze

and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees

and the fat worms waiting on a dawn bright lawn

and he names the sky his own


But a caged bird stands on the grave of dreams   

his shadow shouts on a nightmare scream   

his wings are clipped and his feet are tied   

so he opens his throat to sing.


The caged bird sings   

with a fearful trill   

of things unknown   

but longed for still   

and his tune is heard   

on the distant hill   

for the caged bird   

sings of freedom.
