      <h3>Kaâ€™Ba by Amiri Baraka</h3>
      <p>
        A closed window looks down on a dirty courtyard, and Black people call
        across or scream across or walk across defying physics in the stream of
        their will. Our world is full of sound Our world is more lovely than
        anyone's tho we suffer, and kill each other and sometimes fail to walk
        the air. We are beautiful people With African imaginations full of masks
        and dances and swelling chants with African eyes, and noses, and arms
        tho we sprawl in gray chains in a place full of winters, when what we
        want is sun. We have been captured, and we labor to make our getaway,
        into the ancient image; into a new Correspondence with ourselves and our
        Black family. We need magic now we need the spells, to raise up return,
        destroy,and create. What will be the sacred word?
      </p>

      <h3>Caged Bird By Maya Angelou</h3>
      <p>
        A free bird leaps on the back of the wind and floats downstream till the
        current ends and dips his wing in the orange sun rays and dares to claim
        the sky. But a bird that stalks down his narrow cage can seldom see
        through his bars of rage his wings are clipped and his feet are tied so
        he opens his throat to sing. The caged bird sings with a fearful trill
        of things unknown but longed for still and his tune is heard on the
        distant hill for the caged bird sings of freedom. The free bird thinks
        of another breeze and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees and
        the fat worms waiting on a dawn bright lawn and he names the sky his own
        But a caged bird stands on the grave of dreams his shadow shouts on a
        nightmare scream his wings are clipped and his feet are tied so he opens
        his throat to sing. The caged bird sings with a fearful trill of things
        unknown but longed for still and his tune is heard on the distant hill
        for the caged bird sings of freedom.
